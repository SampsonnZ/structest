Couldn't get this structure to generate, Minecraft 1.15.2/Forge 1.15.2-31.1.48

I just started messing with trying to make something I built with a structure block spawn.
I had mostly been basing my code on the igloo code, as it to me seemed easiest to understand.
It was not working, so I posted on the Forge modder support forums, because I was blind to what I was doing wrong. :(

Thanks to these guys for helping me find the places I missed stuff!

If anyone has any good links to references explaining how feature Placement configuration works, or structure Templates, definitely open an issue with links or something!
